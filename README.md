## Store using hooks from React.js


### `What is it?`
This is simple web app to add items to an store and seller. It has also a nice background animation that you will be able to see when running the project. 

### `Tech used for this project`
React.Js(HOOKS)
Semantic-UI

### `Why did I use this tech?`
I have noticed that most of the companies are trying to move to hooks from react. As we know, react introduce a year ago hooks to be able to interact with states using functional components, It allows to keep a clean code and code less. Indeed, we can have less code. 

### `LOCAL DB`
The data is stored locally, I only wanted to interact with hooks and no back-end involved. 

### `Do you want to run this project?`

Just donwload the project and run in using yarn start or npm start, after being installed.
